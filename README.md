# pytoion
Simple function to control toio in Python.

## Requirement
This functions depends on [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy).

See [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy) first.

```bash

I would recommend having command-line tools from BlueZ available for debugging. (for Raspberry Pi See [RPi Bluetooth LE](https://www.elinux.org/RPi_Bluetooth_LE)
